🧠 Ryzen Virtual Lab

“A futuristic space for experiments without boundaries.”

🚀 Overview

Ryzen Virtual Lab is a web-based virtual laboratory prototype designed as part of a college field project — and more importantly, as a personal passion project to revolutionize how students and researchers interact with experiments online.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Ryzen brings the essence of real-world lab experimentation into an interactive, browser-based environment where anyone can learn, simulate, and experiment without the need for physical lab setups.

🎯 Project Vision

Modern education deserves tools that make practical learning accessible to everyone.
The goal of Ryzen is to:

🧩 Simplify lab experiments through visual simulation.

💡 Encourage hands-on learning, even remotely.

⚙️ Bridge the gap between theory and application.

🌐 Democratize access to technical labs for all students.

🧩 Key Features

🧱 Component-Based Simulation – Users can drag, drop, and connect lab components virtually.

🧮 Real-Time Interaction – Perform calculations, measurements, and observe changes instantly.

🖥️ Responsive Interface – Built with HTML, CSS, and JS for smooth and modern usability.

🔄 Reset & Export Options – Save, load, or share experiment results easily.

🧑‍🔬 Future Integration – Planned AI assistance, performance analytics, and experiment report generation.
